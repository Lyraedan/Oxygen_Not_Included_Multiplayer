# Oxygen Not Included – Multiplayer Mod (WIP)

> **Note:** This is a work-in-progress project. Not to be confused with [onimp/oni_multiplayer](https://github.com/onimp/oni_multiplayer).

A new mod that introduces multiplayer functionality to *Oxygen Not Included*, featuring a custom networking layer and lobby system.

## What's Done

- Network infrastructure for sending and receiving packets  
- Creating, joining, and leaving lobbies  
- Host detection

## Work in Progress

- Move chore synchronization (implemented, currently undergoing testing)  
- Preventing Duplicants, critters, etc. from moving on clients (their positions will be synchronized from the host)

## What's Planned

- World state synchronization  
- Seamless mid-game hosting (start multiplayer at any point during gameplay)  
- Menu and UI synchronization  
- Additional features to be announced

## Why not just contribute to the old multiplayer mod?

I like the old multiplayer mod — I do — and kudos to the guys that made it. But its implementation is very limited without a lot of extra effort, if not a full rewrite.  
On top of this, it hasn't seen activity in over 6 months.  
> **NOTE:** as of June 7th 2025, when I started this project.

Initially it was just conceptual, but once I got lobbies and packets set up, I knew I was onto something.
