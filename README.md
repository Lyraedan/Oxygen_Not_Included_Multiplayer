A public trello board exists that tracks whats been done, and what is coming in the next update you can find that [here](https://trello.com/b/kq7yVWyU/oxygen-not-included-together)

## Found an issue?

Raise it on the issues page, and make a bug report on the discord.

Please at least try to include a video if you can. It makes replicating it so much easier

## Why not just contribute to the old multiplayer mod?

I like the old multiplayer mod — I do — and kudos to the guys that made it. But its implementation is very limited without a lot of extra effort, if not a full rewrite.  
On top of this, it hasn't seen activity in over 6 months.

> **NOTE:** as of June 6th 2025, when I started this project.

Initially it was just conceptual, but once I got lobbies and packets set up, I knew I was onto something.

## Setup

To get started with building the mod, follow these steps:

1. **Install .NET Framework 4.7.2**  
   Make sure you have [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) installed on your system.

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Lyraedan/Oxygen_Not_Included_Multiplayer.git
   ```

3. **Open the solution**  
   Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE).

4. **Copy the file `Directory.Build.props.default` and rename it to `Directory.Build.props.user` file, then adjust the paths**  
   Open the `.csproj` file and find the file under `Solution Items`.
   Copy it and rename the copy to `Directory.Build.props.user`, then open that new file.
   Change its variable `GameLibsFolder` to point to your local `OxygenNotIncluded_Data/Managed` folder, for example:
   ```xml
   <GameLibsFolder>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OxygenNotIncluded\OxygenNotIncluded_Data\Managed</GameLibsFolder>
   ```
   then adjust the variable `ModFolder` to point at your local dev folder, for example:
   ```xml
   <ModFolder>E:\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\dev</ModFolder>
   ```
5. **(optional) Restore NuGet packages**

6. **Build the project**  
   Once the `ManagedPath` is correctly set, build the project.  
   If everything is configured correctly, the build should succeed.
   If there are missing reference errors, restart Visual Studio, the solution creates a publicized reference library the first time a build runs and this can confuse the IDE.
